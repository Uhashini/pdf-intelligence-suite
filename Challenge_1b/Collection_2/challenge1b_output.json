It can analyze multiple documents to uncover similarities, differences, and key patterns. With AI Assistant, you can make targeted requests, such as highlighting the differences between PDF contracts. It links to text and data table sources within the document. It also suggests follow-up questions for you based on the primary question. AI Assistant uses the latest AI language model, GPT 4o, to provide more accurate and clear answers to your queries based on more citations. It can extract information accurately from tables and complex documents. Generative summary automatically provides an outline with headings and summaries to highlight key points in the document. The feature generates key insights that help you easily comprehend the PDF content. For a speedier response, it processes PDF content in chunks and simultaneously streams summaries. You can access the generative AI features in Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Acrobat desktop on both Windows and macOS, on Acrobat online, and within Acrobat extensions for Google"
